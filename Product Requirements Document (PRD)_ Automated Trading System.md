# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): Automated Trading System**

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a personal automated trading system designed to enable users to execute systematic, data-driven investment strategies. The system's core purpose is to remove human emotion and cognitive bias from the trading process, ensuring consistent, rules-based execution of a predefined strategy.1 This blueprint is for a professional-grade solution, inspired by the principles of successful quantitative funds, that provides a disciplined and reliable framework for aggressive portfolio management.

## **2\. Product Vision and Goals**

The vision is to democratize sophisticated algorithmic trading by providing a robust, user-friendly platform that integrates seamlessly with a user's existing brokerage accounts.

**Key Goals:**

* **Automation:** Enable the mechanical execution of a user's trading strategy, removing the emotional influences that lead to poor investment decisions.3  
* **Discipline:** Enforce a strict, rule-based approach to trading, including a non-negotiable risk management framework.5  
* **Transparency:** Provide comprehensive monitoring and reporting to give users a clear, data-backed understanding of their strategy's performance.6  
* **Flexibility:** Allow for the development and testing of a wide range of trading strategies, from simple to complex, without requiring institutional-grade infrastructure.8

## **3\. Core Features**

### **3.1 Brokerage and Connectivity Module**

This module handles all communication with external financial institutions.

* **API Integration:** The system must connect to any brokerage account that offers an API for retail users.11 The system will be designed to integrate with a variety of broker APIs, including those from providers like Interactive Brokers.14  
* **Hybrid API Architecture:** A hybrid approach will be used to leverage the strengths of different protocols.17  
  * **REST API:** Used for low-frequency interactions such as placing and canceling orders, and querying historical data.3  
  * **WebSocket API:** Used for real-time, low-latency market data streaming (e.g., live order book and tick-by-tick trades).3  
* **Security:** API access will be secured through multiple best practices.18  
  * **Least Privilege:** API keys will be granted only the minimum required permissions (e.g., trading and read-only access).18  
  * **Secure Storage:** API keys and sensitive credentials will be stored as encrypted environment variables, never hard-coded in the application.18  
  * **IP Whitelisting:** Access to the API will be restricted to a specific, trusted server IP address.18

### **3.2 Strategy Engine**

This is the "brain" of the system, responsible for making trading decisions based on a user's defined logic.

* **Event-Driven Model:** The engine will be event-driven, responding to market events (e.g., a new market data tick) by executing the pre-programmed strategy.20  
* **Strategy Library:** The system will provide a framework for implementing various strategies.8  
  * **Momentum/Trend-Following:** Identify and capitalize on market trends using indicators like moving average crossovers (e.g., 50-day SMA crossing the 200-day SMA), RSI, and MACD.21  
  * **Mean Reversion:** Exploit the tendency of prices to revert to a historical average, using indicators like Bollinger Bands to identify overbought or oversold conditions.25  
  * **Statistical Arbitrage:** Execute "pairs trading" by identifying two historically correlated assets and trading on the expectation that their price ratio will revert to its mean.27  
  * **Options Strategies:** Allow for speculative and risk-defined strategies like buying long call options for pure speculation or using vertical spreads to cap both potential gains and losses.29  
* **Stock Selection:** A programmatic stock screening tool will be included to filter a vast universe of securities based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.32 Users can screen for metrics such as high revenue and EPS growth (e.g., 15-20% annually), high Return on Equity (ROE) (e.g., 15% or more), a low debt-to-equity ratio, and a reasonable PEG ratio.34

### **3.3 Risk Management Module**

This is a critical, independent module that acts as a failsafe, enforcing a strict set of rules to protect capital.

* **Position Sizing:** A core principle is to never risk a disproportionate amount of capital on a single trade.36  
  * **2% Rule:** The system will allow users to implement the 2% rule, which limits the risk on any single trade to no more than 2% of the total account capital.37 The position size is dynamically calculated based on the account value, the stop-loss distance of the trade, and the defined risk percentage.39  
* **Programmatic Exit Strategies:** The system will automatically close positions based on predefined rules to limit losses and protect profits.39  
  * **Stop-Loss Orders:** Support for basic stop-loss orders that convert to a market order when a predetermined price is hit.39  
  * **Trailing Stop-Loss:** The system will support dynamic trailing stops that automatically adjust as a stock's price rises, protecting profits while allowing a position to run.43 Trailing stops can be configured based on a fixed percentage or a dollar amount.43  
  * **Volatility-Based Stops:** Advanced stop-loss logic can be based on the asset's volatility (e.g., using Average True Range, or ATR) to prevent premature exits from normal market noise.39  
* **Portfolio-Level Safeguards:**  
  * **Drawdown Limit:** The system will allow users to set a maximum drawdown threshold (e.g., 20-25%), at which point it will automatically halt trading to prevent catastrophic losses.46  
  * **Diversification:** The system's design will encourage diversification across different asset classes and strategies to reduce the impact of a single-position failure.49

### **3.4 Monitoring and Reporting Module**

This module provides the user with real-time feedback and long-term performance analysis.

* **Live Dashboard:** A multi-panel, customizable dashboard will display real-time positions, open and closed orders, and an equity curve showing the portfolio's live performance.51  
* **Performance Analytics:** The system will automatically generate a comprehensive report of a strategy's performance, including key metrics.6  
  * **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The mean annual growth rate of the portfolio.52  
  * **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio's value, which is a key indicator of downside risk.53  
  * **Sharpe Ratio:** A measure of risk-adjusted returns, with higher values indicating better performance.48  
  * **Profit Factor:** The ratio of gross profits to gross losses.6  
* **Alerting System:** An automated alert mechanism will notify the user of critical events.57  
  * **Trade Signals:** Alerts will be sent when a buy or sell signal is generated by the strategy engine.57  
  * **Risk Breaches:** Notifications for when a position is automatically closed by a stop-loss or when a portfolio-level drawdown limit is reached.47  
  * **System Status:** Alerts for any technical failures, such as a lost API connection.11

## **4\. Technical Requirements and Architecture**

### **4.1 Technology Stack**

* **Programming Language:** Python will be the primary language due to its robust ecosystem and extensive libraries for data analysis and algorithmic trading.8  
* **Libraries:**  
  * **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.23  
  * **Data Acquisition:** Libraries like yfinance to fetch historical and real-time market data.58  
  * **Backtesting:** The system will utilize established open-source backtesting frameworks such as Backtrader, Vectorbt, or LEAN.60

### **4.2 Infrastructure**

* **Hardware:** A basic, dedicated setup is sufficient for most retail-level bots. This includes a reliable 64-bit CPU, 2GB of RAM, and a stable internet connection to ensure continuous operation.63  
* **Hosting:** The system will be designed to run on a local machine or a cloud-based server, providing flexibility for the user.63

## **5\. Backtesting and Validation**

Backtesting is a non-negotiable step before any live deployment.66 The system will provide a rigorous process for validating strategies.

* **Backtesting:** The system will allow users to run a strategy against historical data, simulating its performance across various market conditions.67 The backtester will account for real-world factors like transaction costs, slippage, and market impact to provide a more realistic performance estimate.68  
* **Avoiding Overfitting:** To prevent a strategy from being overly optimized for a specific historical period, the system will support 69:  
  * **Out-of-Sample Testing:** The dataset will be split, with a portion reserved for testing that the model has not seen during its development.70  
  * **Walk-Forward Analysis:** A method for systematically testing the strategy across different time periods to ensure consistent performance.70  
* **Paper Trading:** After a successful backtest, a strategy must be tested in a live, simulated environment using virtual money.72 This is a crucial step to confirm that the system's logic and execution are sound before risking real capital.72

## **6\. Deployment and Operations**

A phased approach to deployment is essential for minimizing risk.

* **Phase 1: Paper Trading:** The strategy will first be deployed to a paper trading account to verify its live performance and identify any real-world issues.33  
* **Phase 2: Live Deployment (Small Capital):** After consistent performance in paper trading, the system will be deployed with a small amount of live capital to ensure all functions operate as intended with real money.45  
* **Phase 3: Scaling:** Only after a period of proven live performance will the user consider gradually scaling the capital committed to the system.8

The system's greatest value is not in a single trade but in its ability to enforce discipline and provide a continuous feedback loop of refinement and improvement. Performance reports will be used to analyze what is "statistically working" and inform the next cycle of strategy development, creating a self-correcting and adaptive system.67
